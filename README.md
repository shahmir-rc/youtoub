#  Youtube â€“ Contentstack Extension

## About this extension

The Youtube extension lets you fetch Youtube videos and display them into a field in your content type. Subsequently, while creating entries, content managers can select only one of the listed videos at a time as the input value for that field, and the details of the video will be saved as JSON in Contentstack.
